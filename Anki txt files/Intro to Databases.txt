What is a data? ; Data can be numerical, textual, visual, or auditory. <br> It can be used in different scopes, such as school, businesses, apps, etcetera. <br> 
What is a database? ; A collection of data in a structured format. <br> 
Why may a database be preferred over another method of data storage? ; <strong>Since the database stores data in a structured way, it helps facilitate data access and queries.</strong> <br> <li>Rules - Ensure data is consisten by enforcing rules.</li> <br> 
How do we access the database as an admin?  ; <em>Through a database management system (DMS)</em> <br> 
What is a database system and what does it help to do? ; A software that manages data in a database. <br> <strong>It helps make sure that data is secure, consistent, and available at all times.</strong> <br> Example includes: <br> <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li> <br> <li>Oracle</li> <br> <li>Postgre SQL</li> <br> 
What is a database application?  ; <em>A software that helps users interact with database systems WITHOUT needing to understand SQL.</em> <br> They can be desktop or web based. <br> 
What are relational databases? ; <em>Based on relational algebra, they use set operations like union, difference and cartesian product.</em> <br> 
The three parts of relational database includesâ€¦ ; <li>Data structure that prescribes how data is organised.</li> <br> <li>Operations that query and manipulate data.</li> <br> <li>Rules that govern valid relational data.</li> <br> 
What are non-relational databases (and how are they stored)? ; AKA NoSQL. <br> Used for large amounts of data. <br> Hashable with key-value pairs. <br> Examples include: <br> <li>MongoDB, Firebase</li> <br> 
What is a database design? ; A specification of database objects such as tables, columns, and data types. <br> <img src="Intro to Databases_0Untitled.png"> <br> 
What are the three phases to database design? ; <li>Analyse the database requirements and build ER diagrams.</li> <br> <li>Map ER diagram to relational model (add relationships).</li> <br> <li>Transfer relational model to SQL tables.</li> <br> 
List the five items included in an ER model. ; <li>Entity</li> <br> <li>Attribute</li> <br> <li>Key Attribute</li> <br> <li>Relationship</li> <br> <li>Cardinality</li> <br> 
What is an entity? ; Any independent object or concept which information is stored. <br> 
What is an attribute?  ; A property of an entity. <br> For example, entity Dogs may have the attribute of date of birth, colour, and owner. <br> 
What is a key attribute? ; A field that is suitible to identify an entity.  <br> For example, a number that is unique to that record. <br> 
What is a relationship? ; Association among entities.  <br> For example, there may be a relationship between a dog and its owner. <br> 
What is a cardinality? ; Number of entities participating in a relationship. It is written as:  <br> \[(0,*)\] <br> Where the first number represents the minimum amount of relationships between the two, and the second means the maximum. <br> For example, each lecturer can supervise 0 to 20 students. Hence, the cardinality between lecturer to student supervising is (0, 20). <br> <img src="Intro to Databases_1Untitled 1.png"> <br> 
Relationships can have _______. What does this mean? ; Attributes. This means that between two entities there might be a shared attribute, for example, entity student has a relationship with entity course, and between these courses they share the same grade, as a grade is mapped per student, and must be stored in the records of the course. <br>
